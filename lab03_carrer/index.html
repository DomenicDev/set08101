    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello world, my name is Domenic Cassisi. I am a visiting student from Germany and only will be here for one
        trimester.
        During my stay, I will visit three different modules. You can get more information on my courses
        <a href="courses.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I began studying computer science at Hochschule Furtwangen University (short: HFU) in 2017. I am now in my sixth
        semester.
        In semester three, I decided to set to focus on Software Engineering which interested me really the most.

        <h4>Arriving at Napier University</h4>
        <p>My first day at Napier was really tough... we did not receive any information on our modules beforehand,
        so we needed to search for the administration office to get everything working. Fortunately,
        the staff was really friendly and helpful and we got things clarified in less than an hour. Thank you!</p>
