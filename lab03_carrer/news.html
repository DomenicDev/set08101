    <h4>Visiting Badminton Sports Club</h4>
    <p>Every thursday, there is a badminton sports club taking place at the ENgage hall near the Sighthill campus.
        The people are quite nice and friendly, the equipment is in good quality also. I definitely can recommend this club to everyone interested in playing badminton.</p>

    <h4>Arriving at Napier University</h4>
    <p>My first day at Napier was really tough... we did not receive any information on our modules beforehand,
        so we needed to search for the administration office to get everything working. Fortunately,
        the staff was really friendly and helpful and we got things clarified in less than an hour. Thank you!</p>
