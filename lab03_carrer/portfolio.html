    <p>
        As a semester project, me and 3 more students developed a software for managing all doctoral student.

    <h4>Development of multi player horror game</h4>
    <p>
        Actually, I hate horror games so much, however, it's really fun to develop one at your own.
        In my first semester, I developed a network based horror game for two people.
        I took it more as a learning experience rather than trying to earn some money with the game.
